                    <h1>Part 1</h1>
                    <h2>Original Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Create an XML version of your resume containing at least three sections:
                        general information about you; your educational background, and your work
                        experience. Create a schema for the XML document, and then create an XSLT
                        for the XML document so that it can be rendered in a browser. Save all three
                        files (resume.xml, resume.xsd, and resume.xsl) for Part 1 in the directory
                        TMA1/part1.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Interpretation of the Part</h2>
                    <p>
                        Create an XML that contains information about my resume. Use XSD to define a
                        schema in order to create a structure for my resume such as the types of
                        information that should be contained in each categories of my resume.
                        Finally, use XSLT to render the the info in my resume such that the XSLT
                        caters to the schema definition and the code is reused for formats that are
                        repeated.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        The XSD schema is defined to create a general structure of the resume where
                        the XML document is used to contain the actual content of the resume. Then,
                        the XSLT is used to define the content of the HTML and convert the contents
                        of the XML so that it can be rendered on the web. With the XSD schema, the
                        general format of each tag and its corresponding restrictions are included
                        to define what contents a resume should have. With the XSLT, it is created
                        in a way such that a template is created for each unique tag. As some of the
                        categories share common tags, these common tags can be reused by selecting
                        the common tag and applying.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Documentation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The resume contains three categories, general info, educational background
                        and work experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        website must exist. All tags except phone number must exist once. Phone
                        number tag can occur a maximum of three times. Name must have first, middle

                        must be a Canadian postal code that is restricted using regex
                        "[A-Z][0-9][A-Z] ?[0-9][A-Z][0-9]".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within educational background, education tag must exist but can occur more

                        Within work, name, location, position, period and description exists, Name
                        is a string, position is string and description is composed of points that
                        must occur once to five times which is also a string. Location and period is
                        similar to the data type mentioned in educational background.
