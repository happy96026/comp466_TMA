                    <h2>Setup and Running</h2>
                    <p>
                        A local web server must be running at root directory of TMA1 folder. One way
                        to host a local server is using Python3 with the command "python3 -m
                        http.server --bind localhost".

                    <h1>Part 1</h1>
                    <h2>Original Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Create an XML version of your resume containing at least three sections:
                        general information about you; your educational background, and your work
                        experience. Create a schema for the XML document, and then create an XSLT
                        for the XML document so that it can be rendered in a browser. Save all three
                        files (resume.xml, resume.xsd, and resume.xsl) for Part 1 in the directory
                        TMA1/part1.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Interpretation of the Part</h2>
                    <p>
                        Create an XML that contains information about my resume. Use XSD to define a
                        schema in order to create a structure for my resume such as the types of
                        information that should be contained in each categories of my resume.
                        Finally, use XSLT to render the the info in my resume such that the XSLT
                        caters to the schema definition and the code is reused for formats that are
                        repeated.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        The XSD schema is defined to create a general structure of the resume where
                        the XML document is used to contain the actual content of the resume. Then,
                        the XSLT is used to define the content of the HTML and convert the contents
                        of the XML so that it can be rendered on the web. With the XSD schema, the
                        general format of each tag and its corresponding restrictions are included
                        to define what contents a resume should have. With the XSLT, it is created
                        in a way such that a template is created for each unique tag. As some of the
                        categories share common tags, these common tags can be reused by selecting
                        the common tag and applying.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Documentation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The resume contains three categories, general info, educational background
                        and work experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within general info, name, position, phone number, email, address and
                        website must exist. All tags except phone number must exist once. Phone
                        number tag can occur a maximum of three times. Name must have first, middle

                        number tag where type can be from "home", "cell", and "work" and number is a
                        string that is in the format of "xxx-xxx-xxxx". Email is a string where the
                        it is filtered using the regex "[^@]+@[^\.]+\.[^\.]+" and address must
                        contain number, street, apartment, city, province and postal code. Number is
                        an int, street is string, apartment is int that is optional, province is
                        string that must be a abbreviation of a Canadian province and postal code
                        must be a Canadian postal code that is restricted using regex
                        "[A-Z][0-9][A-Z] ?[0-9][A-Z][0-9]".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within educational background, education tag must exist but can occur more
                        than once. Within education, instituion, location, degree and period exists.

                        Using the web technologies you have learned so far, including HTML5, CSS3,
                        JavaScript, XML, and Ajax, write a web application, that can help people to
                        learn to learn the technologies covered in Unit 1, Unit 2, or Unit 3 of the
                        course. The requirements are detailed as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            It must be a web-based system with a name you choose, a banner to show
                            off your work, navigation menus and buttons. It should begin with a
                            welcome page to greet the users, to explain what the application does,
                            and what they get from it, and how they should procced.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The application must have three pages of tutorials, accessible through
                            navigation menus or buttons, to teach the technologies covered in Unit
                            1, Unit 2 and Unit 3 respectively. You donâ€™t need to teach everything,
                            but there should be enough content to make each of the tutorials useful.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There should be a quiz for each tutorial, which can be accessed right
                            after the tutorial page, as well as through the navigation menus and
                            buttons of the system.

                        <li>
                            After the submission button is hit, the quiz system should be able to
                            grade the answers the learner has provided, show the correct answers as
                            well as the score in percentage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The quiz system should be designed so that questions can be easily
                            edited, added, or deleted, and new quiz can be easily created.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You should do your best to use the web technologies covered in Unit 1,
                            unit 2 and Unit 3, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, XML and Ajax.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your web application should use or teach at least five page-structure

                            You should use an external style sheet for all pages of the system, to
                            retain a consistent and user-friendly interface for your system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When using HTML5 table, be sure that you only use it to display tabular
                            information, not to lay out the elements on your page.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        You must pay attention to both the functionalities and user interface. Save
                        Part 2 files in the directory TMA1/part2.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Interpretation of the Part</h2>
                    <p>
                        Create a web application that provides a tutorial of the basics of web
                        development topics that are included in Unit 1 to 3 of COMP 466 which
                        consists of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Ajax. The application offers a quiz
                        for each unit that aims to evalute the users about the respective topics.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        A document was created for introduction, notes, quiz and end. JavaScript
                        code was created to load header and sidebar in order to enforce reusability.
                        Similarly, notes for each section and quizzes for each unit was loaded using
                        JavaScript code where the section can be inputted using GET parameter
                        "section" and quiz unit can be inputted using GET parameter "quiz".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The header acts as a placeholder for items that can be useful in the future.
                        Currently, only a banner is included that redirects to home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sidebar acts a collection of navigation links that allows users to
                        freely see the content that is available in the web application as well as
                        go to content that they want to see.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The buttons on the bottoms allow users to go forward to next step of the
                        tutorial and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data for notes and quizzes are stored using json format since json files are
                        simple to parse using Ajax. Notes are stored for each unit and quizzes are
                        stored for each unit as well.

                        For this project, you are required to create a slideshow web application
                        using HTML5 canvas and other web technologies you have learned so far. The
                        requirements are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The slideshow should be drawn on the canvas;</li>
                        <li>There should be a caption for each image in the show;</li>
                        <li>There should be a button to start/stop the show;</li>
                        <li>
                            There should be a control to toggle the show between random and
                            sequential;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There should be buttons to manually turn the show backward or forward,
                            only if the show is in sequential mode;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There should be a dropdown list for users to select different
                            transition/transformation effects for the show;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The data of the images should be in a JSON array so that images and
                            their captions can be easily maintained;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To avoid copyright issues, you should use the images/photos you took. If
                            you donâ€™t have the images ready, please go around the place you live or
                            work and take some good ones;
                        </li>
                        <li>The show should have at least 20 nice pictures.</li>

                        Design a slideshow application that uses HTML5's canvas elements. The images
                        are to be stored in a JSON file so that they can easily be accessed by the
                        application as well modified by the user. The application should include
                        features such as pause/play, previous/next, change transition animation and
                        sequential/random order of images. The pause/play button should only be
                        enabled when the application is in sequential mode.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        Images are stored in img directory. A JSON file exists that has the path to
                        the image files that are stored in img directory with its respective
                        captions. The application creates a request for the JSON file and creates an
                        array of Image object and its respective caption so that it does not have to
                        make another request when these resources are accessed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are four buttons and one dropdown for choosing the different
                        transition. The buttons are Random/Sequential, Stop/Play, Prev and Next.
                        When the application is in Random mode (button should display Sequential),
                        Prev and Next buttons are greyed out. The Prev and Next button allows to
                        transition to the next image according to the type of transition that is
                        being used. The transitions available are No Transition and Fade where No
                        Transition does not have any animation and Fade decreases the opacity of the
                        current image and increases the opacity of the next image within a time
                        frame.

                            (10 marks) A utility tool that you think could be useful. You may need
                            to do some research on the Web to build this last tool, and in the
                            report you need to justify why you think it will be useful.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        In order to get full marks for the above design and implementation, the

                        The utility tools must be simple to use and user-friendly. Each tool must be
                        event driven and produce results when enough inputs have been given. Updates
                        to the document are made asynchronously.

                    <h2>Analysis and Design</h2>
                    <p>
                        A tool is displayed when the corresponding tool is selected using the
                        navigation bar. Ajax call is made to retrieve the tool's html content and is
                        appended to the document. After the tool's html has been loaded, its
                        corresponding Javascript file is loaded in order to attach the event
                        listener for its inputs.

                    <p>
                        For the unit converter, the user has the option to choose the type of units
                        such as weight, length, area and volume. Then, the units available for each
                        type of unit can be selected from the dropdowns of the two inputs. Users are
                        able to input from any input boxes and the converted value will display from
                        the other input box that is not being used. The converted value will be
                        displayed whenever a user inputs a value or unit is changed. The conversion
                        factors can be found in measurement_converter/conversion.js where for each
                        type of units, a pair of units (unit1,unit2) are used as keys and the
                        corresponding conversion factor is used as values. To convert from unit1 to
                        unit2, value of unit1 must be multipled by the conversion factor. Conversly,
                        to convert from unit2 to unit1, value of unit2 must be divided by the
                        conversion factor.

                        For the mortgage calculator, the user can input the mortgage principal
                        amount, interest rate, amortization period and payment frequency. The
                        mortgage principal and interest rate are user inputs from an input box while
                        the amortization period and payment frequency are dropdowns. When all the
                        required values are included, mortgage payment, total payment and total
                        interest payment is updated.

                        Although BMI is not a perfect indicator of health condition since it does
                        not take into factor muscle mass, I chose to create the BMI calculator
                        because it is still a good starting indicator of someone's health. The users
                        are able to choose between metric and imperial units where metric units are
                        in cm and kg and the imperial units are in ft/in and lbs. After height and
                        weight are inputted, BMI is calculated and displayed asynchronously.
