    <name>Introduction to HTML5</name>
    <content>
        <point>HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language 5) is a markup language that specifies the structure and content of documents that are displayed in web browsers.</point>
        <point>The document type declaration (DOCTYPE) is required in HTML5 documents so that browsers render the page in standards mode.</point>
        <point>Comments start with &lt;!-- and end with --&gt;</point>
        <point>The head section contains information about the HTML5 document, such as the character set (UTF-8, the most popular character-encoding scheme for the web) that the page use.</point>
        <point>The head section also can contain special document-formatting instructions called CSS3 style sheets and client-side programs called scripts for creating dynamic web pages.</point>
        <point>The body section contains the page's content, which the browser displays when the user visits the web page.</point>
        <point>HTML5 elements and attribute names are case insensitive.</point>
        <point>The title element describes the web page.</point>
        <point>All text placed between the <p> and </p> tags forms one paragraph.</point>
        <point>HTML5 provides six heading elements (h1 through h6) for specifying the relative importance of information.</point>
        <point>A hyperlink references or links to other resources, such as HTML5 documents and images.</point>
        <point>Attribute href (hypertext reference) specifies a resource's location.</point>
        <point>The most popular image formats used by web developers today are PNG (Portable Network Graphics) and JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group).</point>
        <point>The img element's src attribute specifies an image's location.</point>
        <point>HTML5 provides character entity references (in the form &code;) for representing special characters that cannot be rendered otherwise.</point>
        <point>A horizontal rule, indicated by the &lt;hr&gt; tag renders a horizontal line with extra space above and below it in most browsers.</point>
        <point>Unordered list element ul creates a list in which each item in the list begins with a bullet symbol.</point>
        <point>Tables are frequently used to organize data into rows and columns.</point>
        <point>A table can be split into three distinc sections, head, body and table foot.</point>
        <point>HTML5 provides forms for collecting information from users.</point>
        <point>The action attribute of the form element specifies the script to which the form data will be sent.</point>
        <point>The submit input element is a button. When the button is pressed, the form's data is sent to the location specified in the form's action attribute.</point>
        <point>To link interally to an element with its id attribute set, use the syntax #id.</point>
        <point>One way that search engines catalog pages is by reading the meta element's contents.</point>
